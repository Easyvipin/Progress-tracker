# Progress-tracker

You can enter your goal into this tracker and it will create a calendar specially for tracking that goal. You can use the colors at the end of the calendar to track your progress by using the color codes: Green=good progress, purple=reasonably good progress and red=not so good progress. When you want to clear out all the calendars and start afresh, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the clear button.
